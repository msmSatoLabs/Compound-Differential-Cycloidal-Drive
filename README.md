# High-Torque Two-Stage Cycloidal Drive for Robotic Arm

A custom-designed, 3D-printed two-stage cycloidal drive developed as the transmission for a high-torque robotic arm joint.

The project explores the design, manufacturing, and control of a high-ratio transmission capable of converting the high-speed, relatively low-torque output of a BLDC motor into the high-torque, low-speed motion required for a robotic arm.

## Project Overview

The transmission is a custom **two-stage cycloidal drive** designed to serve as a high-torque joint actuator for a robotic arm.

The original design target was a **121:1 overall reduction ratio**, allowing a relatively compact BLDC motor to produce substantially higher torque at the output.

The gearbox was designed, parametrically modeled, 3D printed, assembled, and connected to the motor. Future testing will characterize its actual reduction ratio, torque capacity, backlash, friction, and efficiency.

# Design Philosophy

The project was designed around several goals:

### High torque density

The robotic arm requires substantially more torque than the BLDC motor can provide directly. The gearbox therefore uses a high reduction ratio to trade rotational speed for output torque.

### Compact transmission

Cycloidal drives can achieve very high reduction ratios within a relatively compact package, making them attractive for robotic joints where gearbox size and weight are important.

### Manufacturability

Rather than designing around specialized industrial manufacturing processes, the gearbox was designed to be manufacturable using accessible tools and FDM 3D printing.

### Modular design

The transmission is divided into stages and assemblies so that individual components can be redesigned or replaced without completely rebuilding the mechanism.

### Iterative development

The design was developed through repeated cycles of:

**CAD → 3D print → assembly → testing → identify problems → redesign**

This resulted in several design changes involving bearing placement, tolerances, support structures, surface flatness, and component alignment.

# Transmission Architecture

The gearbox consists of **two cycloidal reduction stages**.

The first stage receives the high-speed input from the BLDC motor and produces a reduced-speed intermediate motion.

The second stage further reduces this motion and produces the final output.

The drive uses a nontraditional architecture in which the **outer ring assembly of the second stage acts as the final output**, rather than using the central cycloidal disc as the conventional output member.

This allows the second stage to act as a coupler between the first stage and the final output, but also creates additional requirements for maintaining concentricity and structural stability.

</p>

# Reduction Ratio

The target reduction ratio was designed to be 121:1

The two-stage configuration was selected to achieve this ratio while keeping the number of rollers and individual components manageable.

Each stage follows the cycloidal relationship in which the number of lobes is one less than the number of rollers.

Thus, the first stage contains 11 lobes on the cycloidal disc and 12 rollers, while the second stage contains 10 lobes on the cycloidal disc and 11 rollers.

The first-stage transmission ratio is calculated based on the following expression:

$$
u_1 = -\frac{Z_{11}}{Z_{12} - Z_{11}}
$$

where $Z_{11}$ is the number of teeth of the first-stage cycloidal disc (11) and $Z_{12}$ is the number of rollers of the stationary ring gear of the first stage (12).

The second-stage transmission ratio is calculated based on the following expression:

$$
u_2 = -\frac{Z_{21}}{Z_{22} - Z_{21}}
$$

where $Z_{21}$ is the number of teeth of the second-stage cycloidal disc (10) and $Z_{22}$ is the number of rollers of the rotatable ring gear of the second stage (11).

In the case of a "one tooth difference" cycloidal drive,

$$
Z_{12} - Z_{11} = 1, \qquad Z_{22} - Z_{21} = 1,
$$

as is the case here, the final expression for the speed reducer ratio $u_{\mathrm{CR}}$ is

$$
u_{\mathrm{CR}} = Z_{11} \cdot Z_{22} = 11 \cdot 12 = 121
$$

### Important distinction

**121:1 is the theoretical/design ratio, not a verified experimental measurement.**

Because the complete gearbox has now been assembled and connected to the motor, the next step is to measure the actual input-to-output angular displacement directly.

The measured ratio may differ from the theoretical value due to:

* Manufacturing tolerances
* Assembly errors
* Backlash
* Elastic deformation
* Slippage
* Incorrect assumptions in the theoretical model

# Cycloidal Geometry

The cycloidal discs were generated parametrically using the primary design parameters:

* Ring roller PCD: **176 mm**
* Roller radius: **11 mm**
* Eccentricity: **3 mm**
* Stage 1 rollers: **12**
* Stage 1 lobes: **11**
* Stage 2 rollers: **11**
* Stage 2 lobes: **10**

With these, the following parametric equations were then used to generate the profile of the cycloidal drives:

$$
x(t) =
R\cos(t) -
R_r\cos\left(
t+
\arctan\left(
\frac{\sin((1-N)t)}
{\frac{R}{EN}-\cos((1-N)t)}
\right)
\right) -
E\cos(Nt)
$$

$$
y(t) =
-R\sin(t)
+
R_r\sin\left(
t+
\arctan\left(
\frac{\sin((1-N)t)}
{\frac{R}{EN}-\cos((1-N)t)}
\right)
\right)
+
E\sin(Nt)
$$

</p>

The parametric approach allows the cycloidal profile to be regenerated when changing:

* Number of rollers
* PCD
* Roller diameter
* Eccentricity
* Reduction ratio
* Manufacturing tolerances

<img width="893" height="788" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bde15819-0750-4a92-99d5-8f6896092f18" />
*Stage 1 Reduction*

*Stage 2 Reduction*

This was particularly useful during the iterative development process because changes to the gearbox geometry could be propagated without manually rebuilding the cycloidal profile.

# Bearing System

The gearbox uses multiple ball bearings to support and guide the rotating assemblies.

A major design challenge was supporting the large second-stage output.

A single large bearing would have provided a simple solution, but its cost was undesirable for the prototype.

Instead, the design uses **multiple smaller bearings distributed around the circumference** to approximate the support provided by a larger bearing.

This distributes the radial load around the gearbox while keeping the components relatively inexpensive and accessible.

# Manufacturing

The prototype was primarily manufactured using **FDM 3D printing**.

PETG was used for the initial prototype because of its accessibility and relatively good mechanical properties.

Carbon-fiber reinforced nylon and PETGCF20 was also investigated as a potential material for higher-performance components, specifically for the cycloidal discs and shaft components.

The printed components required significant post-processing, including:

* Support removal
* Bearing installation
* Heat-set insert installation
* Surface sanding
* Dimensional adjustment
* Assembly and alignment

</p>

# Engineering Challenges

Several problems were encountered during development.

### Surface flatness

Large surfaces printed over support material were not perfectly flat, causing the two halves of the first-stage ring gear to sit unevenly.

This introduced alignment issues with the base piece alignment.

The problem was partially corrected through sanding, but it also demonstrated the limitations of relying on large FDM surfaces for precision alignment when printing with supports.

<p align="center">
  <img width="75%" alt="Ring gear surface flatness issue" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05fdaaf0-612d-4539-b593-2a19ae678f31" />
</p>

### Bearing installation

Support material remaining inside bearing pockets interfered with installation.

This led to changes in support geometry and highlighted the importance of designing parts around post-processing requirements, rather than only considering the final CAD geometry.

### Component tolerances

The gearbox contains many interacting components, so relatively small dimensional errors can accumulate.

The physical prototype was therefore used to determine which tolerances needed to be modified for future iterations.

### Structural considerations

The gearbox is intended to produce very high output torque, meaning that printed components cannot simply be evaluated based on their nominal material strength.

Print orientation, layer adhesion, fastener locations, bearing loads, and stress concentrations all need to be considered.
